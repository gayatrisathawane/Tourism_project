        <p> The Lal Mahal (Red Palace) of Pune is one of the most famous monuments located in Pune. In the year 1630 AD,
            Chhatrapati Shivaji’s Father Shri Shahaji Bhosale, established the Lal Mahal for his wife Jijabai and son.
            Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj stayed here for several years until he captured his first fort. The original Lal
            Mahal fell into ruins and the current Lal Mahal is a reconstruction of the original and located in the
            center of the Pune city. Historically, the Lal Mahal is famous for an encounter between Chhatrapati Shivaji
            Maharaj and Shaista Khan where Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj cut off the later’s fingers when he was trying to
            escape from the window of the Lal Mahal
            History:-
            In the year 1630 AD, Shivaji Maharaj's Father Shahaji Raje Bhosale, established the Lal Mahal for his wife
            Jijabai and son. Shivaji Maharaj stayed here for several years until he captured his first fort. The current
            Lal Mahal is a reconstruction of the original and located in the center of the Pune city. The original Lal
            Mahal was built with the idea of rejuvenating the recently razed city of Pune when Shahaji Raje entered the
            city along with Shivaji and his mother, Maasaheb Jijabai. Young Shivaji Maharaj grew up here, and stayed in
            the Lal Mahal till he captured the Torna fort in 1645. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's marriage with his first
            wife, Saibai took place in Lal Mahal on 16 May 1640.[2][3]
            The Lal Mahal is also famous for an encounter between Shivaji Maharaj and Shaista Khan where Shivaji Maharaj
            cut off the latter's fingers when he was trying to escape from the window of the Lal Mahal.[4] This was part
            of a surreptitious guerrilla attack on the massive and entrenched Mughal Army that had camped in Pune, with
            Shaista occupying (possibly symbolically) Shivaji Maharaj's childhood home. As a punishment for the ignominy
            of the defeat despite superior numbers and better armed and fed soldiers, Shaista was transferred by the
            Mughal Emperor to Bengal.[citation needed]
            Towards the end of the 17th Century, the Lal Mahal was ruined by some people and was eventually razed to the
            ground as a result of various attacks on the city.[5] It is said that during the construction of the
            Shaniwarwada, some soil and stones of the Lal Mahal were used for luck. In 1734-35, a few houses were
            constructed on the land of the Lal Mahal and given for use to Ranoji Shinde and Ramchandraji. The records in
            the offices of the Peshwas mention that Lal Mahal was used for arranging feasts for the Brahmins during the
            thread-ceremony of Sadashivrao Bhau, son of Chimaji Appa. The exact original location of the Lal Mahal is
            unknown, however it was known to be very close to the location of Shaniwarwada, which is roughly where the
            current reconstruction stands.
